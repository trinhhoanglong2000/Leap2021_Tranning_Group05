John:
Thank God, Are you okay???
Tom:
Dad, he's here. Be careful!!! He won't let you get here easily
John:
Ok, stay right here. I will come here for you. We will go home together.
Tom:
You promise??
John:
Of course, I promise, let me...

Come on, not again.

There's no time to waste. I can not late again. Let's go!!!

Good luck!!!

There's something written in the book.

"The Spiders lurking in the dark corners of the room.

Be careful with them, being starved for too long makes them more aggressive.

With eyes as red as a car's headlights, it's aimed at you and leaps to you when it's ready.

The jump is so strong and fast that it kills them instantly if they hit a wall."

Oh, I don't want to stand in its way.

Good luck!!!

The Spiders are scarier than I thought.

...

Oh, Tommy. I wish I had spent more time with you.

After this time, I will find another job to spend more time with you.

Enough rest, let's go.

I wonder if The Spiders are strong enough to break the wall.

Good luck!!!

Wow, I didn't expect the spiders to be so strong that they could even break the wall.

Hmmm, When was the last time I sat down to eat with Tom?

When was the last time I played with Tom?

I'm such a bad dad.

... This is not the time for bullshit.

Oh, The ground is shaking, maybe there are rocks rolling ahead.

The room is so dark, maybe I should look at the ground to see where there are rolling rocks.

Good luck!!!

See the sign in the front? That means we've arrived.

Let's defeat him and bring Tom home.

Good luck!!!
