John:
Alright, Where are we now???
Tom:
Dad, he wants to take me away.
John:
Wh..Hold on, what did you say? Who??..
Tom:
I don't know. Hurry Dad, I'm so scared....
John:
It's okay son, let me...

What?!?! What just happend!

Where is my son? OMG!!!

...

I need to get through this place and find my son quickly

Hope it's not too late

Wait!!!...

There's something written right here

The Shadows have slept too long to wait for a day to be awakened by the light and chase their prey.

Once they have caught their prey, they will tear it apart and enjoy a taste they haven't enjoyed in a long time.

But they're just stupid Walking Dead. So use your wisdom and destroy them with deadly traps.

It sounds terrible, but we don't have time and we're running out of battery. Let's go and find some along the way.

Good luck!!!

This book will guide you and bring you back here every time you die. 

But don't die too much, your life is limited.

Good luck!!!

This is easier than I thought. I must hurry to Tom, can't keep him waiting too long.

Hmmm... The next room...choose wisely...listen to your heart.

Why is the book written like that?...Let's go!

Good luck!!!

Hope Tom is okay, I shouldn't have left him alone.

Hmmm...It says run as fast as you can if you don't want to get caught.

What does it mean?

Good luck!!!

Looks like the floor is shaking. What could that be ?

Good luck!!!
