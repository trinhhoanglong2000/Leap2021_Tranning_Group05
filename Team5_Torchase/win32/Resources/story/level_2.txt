What?!?! What just happend!

Where is my son? OMG!!!

...

I need to get through this place and find my son quickly

Hope it's not too late

Wait!!!...

There's something written right here

The Shadows have slept too long to wait for a day to be awakened by the \nlight and chase their prey.

Once they have caught their prey, they will tear it apart and enjoy a taste \nthey haven't enjoyed in a long time.

But they're just stupid Walking Dead. So use your wisdom and destroy them \nwith deadly traps.

It sounds terrible, but we don't have time and we're running out of battery.\nLet's go and find some along the way.

Good luck!!!

This book will guide you and bring you back here every time you die. 

But don't die too much, your life is limited.
